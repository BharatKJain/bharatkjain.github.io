Inspired from a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/_svs_/status/1716347991835984184) by Siddharth Sharma(ex-CTO, Shaadi.com), **please give it a read.**


Key reasons:
- Showcase skills to recruiters by adding project links and technical posts.
- Build your own second brain, dumping technical docs in markdown.
- Opportunity to learn about hosting static websites(specially for backend engineers) and working on raw CSS.
- A good way to find like-minded people and share your work with them.
